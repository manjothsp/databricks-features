It is not recommended to give storage location at metastore level.
If we are skipping at metastore level , it is mandatory to give while creating catalog.

Location can be given while creating schema as well and precendence will be given to schema location.

For creating any new catalog , it is recommended to give a managed location where all managed data will be stored by unity catalog.
Below are the steps to follow:
1) Create storage account and create a container,
2) create a databricks access connector and give it blob contributor role at storage access.
3) Create storage credential in databricks using resource id of this connector.
4) create external location using abfss://<PATH> and create a catalog.

This is the location where managed table data will be stored.

%sql
create external location if not exists <location_name>
url 'abfss://<EMAIL>@<EMAIL>.dfs.core.windows.net/'
WITH (CREDENTIAL <storage_credential_name>);

%sql
create catalog if not exists catalog1
managed location '<location abfss path>'
